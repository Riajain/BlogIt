# BlogIt
In this project we have created an online blogging platform by the name BlogIt. This platform will allow the users to create an account and post blogs.
Latest blogs will be shown on the homepage.
A combination of technologies along with AngularJS have been used.
Bootstrap, which is a frontend framework is used to develop the user interface and Stamplay is used to store our user data in cloud.
index.html contains the basic layout of the blog
The homepage of the blog contains navigation links to login(for already registered users) and signup for new users.
The user can create his own blog and post it. 
A user can also view other blogs as well as comment, upvote or downvote on the viewed blogs.
app.js file contains the controllers and the module that binds the model and view of the blog together.
